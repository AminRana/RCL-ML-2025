# RCL-ML-2025

This repository is maintained by the students of the SWE6204 - Machine Learning module. It serves as a central workspace for uploading and organizing weekly task submissions in the form of Jupyter/Collab Notebooks (.ipynb files).

Each contributor should:

- Upload their weekly notebook in the appropriate WeekX folder (e.g., Week1/, Week2/, etc.).

- Name files clearly, preferably using the format:
  WeekX_YourName_YourHEnumber.ipynb

-Ensure the commit message briefly describes the update (e.g., Added Week 3 - Decision Trees).

This structure helps maintain clarity, makes peer review easier, and supports collaborative tracking of weekly progress.
